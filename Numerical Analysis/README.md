# Numerical Analysis Projects  

This folder contains numerical analysis methods implemented in **C** as part of Computer Engineering studies.  
The projects cover both fundamental and advanced topics, emphasizing dynamic data structures and algorithmic implementation.  

## Project Topics  

1. **Bisection Method**  
2. **Regula-Falsi Method**  
3. **Newton-Raphson Method**  
4. **Inverse of an NxN Matrix** *(N should be dynamic, not fixed)*  
5. **Cholesky (ALU) Method**  
6. **Gauss-Seidel Method**  
7. **Numerical Derivative** *(forward, backward, and central differences)*  
8. **Simpsonâ€™s Method** *(1/3 and 3/8 rules)*  
9. **Trapezoidal Method**  
10. **Gregory-Newton Interpolation** *(without change of variable)*  

## Language & Tools  
- **Language:** C  
- **Libraries Used:** `stdio.h`, `math.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`

## Purpose  
To implement core numerical methods from scratch in C and reinforce understanding of computational problem-solving techniques used in engineering and applied mathematics.
